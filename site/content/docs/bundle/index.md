Darklua is capable of bundling Lua code: it will start from a given file and attempt to merge every require into a single file.

**Warning:** it is important that each module do not have any side effects at require-time, as the order of those side effects may not be preserved in the bundled code.

The process command will bundle Lua code when defined in the configuration file. Defining the `bundle` field will set up darklua to bundle code. The following minimal configuration will bundle code using path requires:

```json5
{
  bundle: {
    require_mode: "path",
  },
}
```

## Process Command

To bundle code, use the process command. Provide the entry point that you would like to bundle from and the second argument is the output location:

```
darklua process entry-point.lua bundled.lua
```

Given the `entry-point.lua`, darklua will recursively follow the requires and inline the code into a single `bundled.lua` file.

## Configuration

### Require Mode

Require modes are what darklua uses to interpret require calls to other modules. They are useful when bundling or when converting require calls using the [`convert_require` rule](../rules/convert_require). When bundling code, darklua uses the require mode defined in the configuration file (in the bundling part) to find the source files.

Currently, there is only **one require mode available for bundling**:

- `path`: support requires using file paths

  ```lua
  local Config = require("./Config")
  local Promise = require("Packages/Promise")
  ```

For more information about how to configure the require mode, take a look at the [path require mode configuration page](../path-require-mode/).

### Excludes

Provide a list of patterns to exclude certain paths from the bundle.

For example, to avoid bundling any require to paths starting with `@lune`:

```json5
{
  bundle: {
    require_mode: "path",
    excludes: ["@lune/**"],
  },
}
```

These patterns are similar to Unix globs, but for more information about the differences and the syntax, see the [pattern library documentation](https://github.com/olson-sean-k/wax/blob/master/README.md#patterns) used by darklua.

### Modules Identifier

When darklua bundles multiple modules into a single file, it uses a variable to store all the required modules. This parameter lets you modify that variable name if needed.

```json5
{
  bundle: {
    require_mode: "path",
    // by default, darklua will use the following value
    modules_identifier: "__DARKLUA_BUNDLE_MODULES",
  },
}
```

## Require Data Files as Lua

When bundling, the `path` require mode is able to require data files and convert them into Lua data. All that is needed is that the file has one of the recognized extensions:

- [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) with `.json` or `.json5`
- [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) with `.yml` or `.yaml`
- [Toml](https://toml.io/en/) with `.toml`

Text files (ending with `.txt`) are also supported and they will simply map to a string with the file content.

If you would like to see a format added, feel free to submit a request using a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/seaofvoices/darklua/issues).
