# This is needed because when runnin `cargo test`, the library and its
# dependencies are build with the `dev` profile. To make sure full_moon
# does not stack overflow when parsing complex code, it needs to be compiled
# at optimization level 3 (which is what release mode uses)
# Info about profiles can be found there:
#     https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html
